I'm currently a self teaching junior level developer who is mostly instrested in Bitcoin, The Lightning Network, Ethereum, and Cryptography, and P2P Networks. I tend to use minimalist software and technology when possible, as I believe internet bloat has gotten out of hand.

When I'm not learning software development or mathematics I do kendo as well as ride Electric Unicycles.
   
- Languages I am learning: C, C++, Rust, Solidity
- How to reach me: Matrix, XMPP, and Twitter to follow.
